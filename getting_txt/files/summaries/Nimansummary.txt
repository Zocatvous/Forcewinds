Form Vi Niman

Niman is an ancient lightsaber style meant specifically to be wielded by those who represent the fury of the Jar’Kai divines from the planet Kashi. It should be noted that each of these two styles of combat within Form VI were created independently. And as such may be purchased and studied simultaneously but they are not compatible in combat as they use similar patterns in the force to comprehend. Any practitioner of Niman knows the cost for such a bristling offense comes at the price of defense. Whenever you wield two lightsabers in Niman style you must halve the combined defensive rating of your weapons, You may attack with each lightsaber wielded by a limb as a simple action. 


Techniques marked with an asterisk cannot be performed with dual lightsabers.


Form Bonus: increased FP pool when in form. 


Striking with Advantage/Disadvantage has no effect on those in the Niman Style.


Rancor Style
 While in Rancor Stance you do not need to pay for Force Powers used during the course of techniques with “rancor” in their type. Rancor keyword techniques may only be executed by a duelist with at least one hand on the weapon(s) executing the attack . Rancor style techniques may be cast out of Rancor stance with spheres but they will need to be paid for accordingly.
