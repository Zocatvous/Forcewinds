Ensigilment


Each of these Force Ritual Inscriptions represent a series of markings upon the bearers skin that solidify their connection to the force in flesh. Performed by the ancient Kwa to their most trusted force sages and seers.This practice was only done by Jed’aii who had learned the secret of the chasm of Anil Kesh and so had been banished from the order. Legend says that each set of sigils could only be given by a Jed’aii seer who had received tutelage from a celestial artificer or one of their Gree artisans. 


The Ensigilments were meant to adorn the seer with conduits to the force so that they could peer into the future and counteract the often overwhelming force storms on the planet Tython, as such certain sigils attune the seers to a particular side of the force to counteract the predominant energy on the planet. However, Some seers soon found that the sigils had, other effects… these are a few of those known to the Kaleth temple. 


Note: Ensigilments Consume 10^(FS) Kyber Dust, Once applied they do not need to be reapplied.


Note: Each attempt to roll takes 1 hour, Rolling a botch attempting to apply one of these ensigilments will incur Stigmata (see Rituals), You must share 1 virtue with the applicant to apply an ensigilment
