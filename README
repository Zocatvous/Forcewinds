The primary function of this repo is to run an instance of the combat.py script in a shell enviroment to keep track of initiative in a role playing game. d10 based RP combat systems like StarWars d10 have a 7-ticks/turn structure that allow different attacks to have different "speeds" which can make gameplay much more fun.

Feel free to clone this repo and run
>python combat.py
   OR
>python GameRun.py
to see how the code works. 

Adding arguments in the Tuple structure shown in the script wiil add characters to the gameplay loop, and any input from the keyboard will advance the TurnTracker 1-tick into the future!

requires Python 3.8

still have to import a setup script to configure virtual enviroment. Should have some pretty easily installed module requirements.txt
